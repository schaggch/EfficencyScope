# EfficencyScope
The goal is to achieve a python script wich connects to the vesc and starts a motor to 95% Dutycycle.
Then the Motor will get load from outside and while this the script is mapping the current, the voltage and the (e)rpm to calculate the efficency and plot an .jpg at the end with the efficency curve vs the amps.
